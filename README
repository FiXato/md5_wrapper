Md5Wrapper
=============

Md5Wrapper wraps the command line utilities md5sum (Linux) and md5 (Mac).
Detecting which utility should be used is based on the RUBY_PLATFORM constant.
It allows obtaining the md5 hexdigest of a file and checking that a file has a specific md5 hexdigest.

This plugin does not aim to provide all features offered by the md5(sum) utilities, but anyone who needs more features is welcome to add them.

Example
=======

Get the md5 hexdigest for a file.
  Md5Wrapper.get_md5sum('foo.txt') #=> 'abcdabcdabcdabcdabcdabcdabcdabcd'

Check the correct md5 hexdigest against a file.
  Md5Wrapper.check_md5sum('foo.txt', 'abcdabcdabcdabcdabcdabcdabcdabcd') #=> true
  
Check an incorrect md5 hexdigest against a file.
  Md5Wrapper.check_md5sum('foo.txt', 'aaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaa') #=> false
